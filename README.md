Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called <span style="color:orange"> **content management systems (CMS)** </span>. <br> Our <span style="color:green"> [_Employee Builder_](https://github.com/SmithCray/employeeBuilder) </span>is designed to do just that, by using our simple and easy command-line application using <span style="color:yellow"> _Node.js_, _Inquirer_, </span> and <span style="color:yellow"> _MySQL_ </span>. Our goal is to provide the ability to view and manage a set of departments, roles, and employees in a given company and organize the return as well as visualize thier buisness.
