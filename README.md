### **Description:**

Meeting people can be hard. That's why [MileHi](https://project2-milehi.herokuapp.com/) exists to create new friendships across the state of
Colorado. Our vision is to be the front page of the outernet - the place that you log into in order to
quickly log out of. You can begin by clicking on any of our recreation categories and browsing the
various activities. Find one you like? Select it to see when and where people are playing, running,
dancing, etc. Have a group you would like to invite people to? Create a posting of your own to let
people know where they can find people like you with their same interests.
<br>
We encourage everyone to be friendly, take pictures, and tag us [@milehi_denver](https://www.instagram.com/milehi_denver/) on <span style="color:yellow">instagram</span> with the ðŸ‘‹ emoji to be
featured weekly on our website!
